# Network Segmentation with UniFi

This project outlines a real-world approach to securing and isolating traffic using UniFi equipment and VLAN configurations. It applies Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) principles and demonstrates how to segment networks for increased security.

## Key Components
- VLAN configuration and tagging
- UniFi firewall rule management
- Role-based access principles
- Zero Trust architecture overview
