### üîê Firewall Rules Overview (Real Network)

This document summarizes the firewall rules active across the following key interfaces on your UniFi setup:
- LAN In / LAN Out
- Internet In / Internet Local / Internet Out
- IPv6 interfaces
- Domain and App filtering

### üõ°Ô∏è Local Interface Blocking (to UDM)

| Action | Source     | Destination | Ports | Rule Name                      |
|--------|------------|-------------|-------|-------------------------------|
| Drop   | IoT        | Gateway     | HTTP/HTTPS/SSH | Block IOT to UDM         |

| Drop   | KidsNetwork| Gateway     | HTTP/HTTPS/SSH | Block KidsNetwork to UDM |

### üîê VPN/Access Services Allowed

- IPsec (UDP, ESP)
- L2TP (UDP 1701)
- OpenVPN Server (TCP 1194)
- UID VPN (UDP 10118)

---

## üåê Internet Out / LAN Out Rules

- Block outbound traffic to/from specific IPs via IPS deny list
- Allow outbound for all VLANs explicitly by subnet (10.0.x.0/24)

---

## üì° IPv6 and Other Rules

- Allow Neighbor Solicitations/Advertisements
- Drop all invalid/unwanted IPv6 traffic
- Allow LAN v6 outbound traffic

---

## üéØ App/Domain Filtering Rules

| Action | Type     | Target        | Rule Name           |
|--------|----------|----------------|---------------------|
| Block  | App      | WhatsApp       | Block WhatsApp      |
| Allow  | Domain   | s2.bl-1.com    | Allow s2.bl-1.com   |

---

### üåê WAN Architecture Note

- ISP connects to Wattbox (power monitor + auto-reboot failover)
- Wattbox feeds **modem**, which is **bridged** to UDM
- UDM (VLAN 1 - Core) serves as the **network gateway/router** to the entire internal VLAN system
- Dual copper ISP feed for redundancy
